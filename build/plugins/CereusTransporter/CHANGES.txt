0.64

0.49 (changes by ThomasUrban@urban-software.de)

0.46 (changes by ThomasUrban@urban-software.de)
 * Fixed InfluxDB connection ( DSN Format : influxdb://user:pass@host:port/dbname )
 
 * Fixed SQL statement looking for host.polling_time only filled/created by modified spine version ( can be manuall set in the MISC settings )
   CASE statement was not working correctly.

0.45 (changes by simonov@gmail.com)
 * Added Bosun export support (http://bosun.org/). Also OpenTSDB. May have broken InfluxDB support, haven't tested it, but should be working.

 * Changed settings back to DB URI instead of db, port and so on in separate settings. Made configuration simpler.

 * Fixed population of data array by key - version 0.4 was loosing too much data (for example, if there was more than one traffic_out, only one was saved)

 * Converted plugin_CereusTransporter_data to a Memory table. Nice improvement in speed. Make sure to make mysql memory table parameters bigger 
(tmp_table_size and max_heap_table_size). Table will be recreated automatically by the upgrade script (hopefully).
Data is considered temporary and gets deleted on every sending pass.

 * Added much more additional data to metrics: host and hostname, data source type (gauge, metric), index type and value if used, units and so on.
Unit name is taken from Vertical Label of Graph Template for datasource. If there are multiple Graph Templates, only one value will be taken.
Vertical Label text should be from this list, or bosun will skip it: https://godoc.org/bosun.org/metadata#Unit
Metrics info for Bosun is sent to different api outlet.

 * Pre-populated all needed info from DB. No SQL queries are made for each metric. HUGE improvement in speed. Now it takes about 90 seconds on average
to send 168k data points into Bosun.

 * Additional stats in poller logs. Example:
CereusTransporter: Poller[0] STATS: Time:98.82 LookupTableSize:32685 LookupUnitsTableSize:22363 MetricsCount:168862 AverageHostTime:0.12 
SlowestHostnames:[host1: 3.544s, host2: 2.784s, host3: 2.216s, host4: 2.159s]
